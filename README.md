In this directory, you can find the project I created for  Assignment 3.

I created it with the Boilderplate VueJs Project provided to us.
Apart from the Boilderplate Project, I used some online resources that I cited in the code. However, I never copied anything, I just used the ideas presented for my solution.

The webpage consists of a year slider to determine the data that should be used, and 2 corresponding visualizations. <br>
One Scatterplot with a bivariate color scheme in the background, implementing tooltips, selection and brushing. Additionally, a map of the USA is shown, where the selection is synced to the Scatterplot and the colors of the datapoints for each state determine its coloring. The Map also implements tooltips and selection.

The bivariate color scheme was created by myself with the help of [this](https://observablehq.com/@benjaminadk/bivariate-choropleth-color-generator) website.

The deployed website can be found [here](https://wwwlab.cs.univie.ac.at/~simone99/VIS21W/A3/)
